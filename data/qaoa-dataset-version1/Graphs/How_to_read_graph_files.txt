The graph files contain lists of upper triangles of adjacency matrices for each connected non-isomorphic graph on up to nine vertices.  The files are generated from the graph data of Brendan McKay

Here's an example of how to read to understand the upper triangles of the adjacency matrices in graph3c.txt:

The first adjacency matrix upper triangle is:

01
1

The first row describes the connections of vertex 0 to vertices 1 & 2.  The first "0" indicates there is not an edge between 0,1 in this graph.  The second "1" indicates there is an edge 0,2 for this graph.

The final row describes the connections of vertex 1 to vertex 2.  The "1" indicates there is an edge 1,2.


The second adjacency matrix upper triangle is:

11
1

Here there are edges between all vertices, since all the entries are "1". 


In general, the number of rows equals the number of vertices-1.  The first row describes the edges incident on vertex 0, the second row describes edges incident on vertex 1, etc.
